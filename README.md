# Procrastination Cure System

The system was developed as the Final Project of my Higher Diploma. MySQL was used as a database for this project.

The main user interface of the system contains a simple table with a group of symbols of user's choice.
The users have to fill a cell when he did any step in their activities and choose the importance rating of
this action. There also will be theoretical and explaining articles. Moreover, for user it must be fun, not
like another routine. For example, it could be an achievement system: a virtual badge for posting 1, 5, 10,
20, etc. actions, or an N-days streak of filling-up the table, or a combo of important actions (not implemented).

The Role-Based Access Control was based on User Cake by Adam Davis and Jonathan Cassels.

Twitter Bootstrap was used as the basis of Front-end.
